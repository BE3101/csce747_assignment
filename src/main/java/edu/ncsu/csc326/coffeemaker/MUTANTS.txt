INVALID MUTANT 
=============================================
Remove line 56 from Inventory.java
[Statement Modification: Statement Deletion]
//int amtChocolate = 0;
Removing the declaration causes a compile failure.
It is therefore invalid.

VALID-BUT-NOT-USEFUL
=============================================
[Statement Modification: Constructor Deletion]
Deleting the RecipeBook constructor at line 13 of RecipeBook.java
causes most tests to fail in RecipeBookTest.java because the 'recipeArray'
object is null; Thus it is not useful.

USEFUL (2)
=============================================
[Expression Modification]
Line 123 of Inventory.java (Caught by TestSetMilkPosValue())
     //milk >= 0	
    if(milk < 0) {
This prevents 'milk' from being set.
    
[Operand Modification: replace constant values]
Line 48 of RecipeBook.java (Not Caught by original tests)
Changed TRUE to FALSE	
Added testAddrecipe() to RecipeBookTest.java to evaluate adding
a recipe to the recipeArray collection. It was not originally detected 
because the fault involved an interaction between CoffeeMaker.java and
RecipeBook.java.


EQUIVALENT 
=============================================
[Expression Modification]
Line 88 of CoffeeMaker.java 
Setting 'change' to 999 instead of 0 has no effect 
since 'change' is immediately overwritten
